/*
  1) Create the following class hierarch * vehicle ---> Car ---> Electric Car.
  2) Each Class should have "move()" method that print a specific message like-
     # vehicle is moving!
     # car is running on fuel.
     # ElectricCar is running silently!
  3) In main method:
     --> Declare a reference type Vehicle &
         Assign it to object of each subclass (vehicle, Car, Electric Car)
     --> call the move() using the "Vehicle" reference each time & observe which version of method executes.
